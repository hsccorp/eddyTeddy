Initial experiments with EddyStone, google's beacon protocol

a) Run this on either android or iOS devices (need to support BT4)
b) If you don't have a Eddystone beacon, run a simulator - I used node-eddystone-beacon-emulator and ran it as DEBUG=eddystone node cli.js --uri=http://www.hsc.com (for debug logs)
